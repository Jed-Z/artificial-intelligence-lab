"""
This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to control Pacman.  To
select an agent, use the '-p' option when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be
passed to your agent using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the project
description.

Please only change the parts of the file you are asked to.  Look for the lines
that say

"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

The parts you fill in start about 3/4 of the way down.  Follow the project
description for details.

Good luck and happy searching!

    # 松弛问题：忽略墙的存在，每步可以移动到相邻的任意位置（当然，不能超出边界）
    # 启发函数：pacman从当前位置到最近的食物的距离，加上任意食物之间最远的距离
    # 思想：若要吃掉所有食物，pacman必然会先移动到任意一个食物的位置上去吃掉它；
    #     其次，为了吃掉所有食物，它至少会移动任意食物之间最远的距离。因此，二
    #     者之和显然是原问题的解的一个下界，因而是可满足的。当pacman走了一步，
    #     启发函数h的值最多下降1——离最近的食物更近了一步，或者若吃掉了离它最近
    #     的食物后，新的最近的食物和相距最远的两个食物发生改变。由于使用曼哈顿
    #     距离，该启发函数是一致的。
